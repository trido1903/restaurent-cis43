What I have learned in this project:
  - Getting familiar with Object-Oriented-Programming.
  - Using constructor to pass all the variable from one screen to another.
  - Sketch the diagram to make the progress of developing this app easier.

Future improvement:
  - Using the persistent database such as: MySQL, Mongodb, Firebase,...
  - Adding more functionality so that the admin can manage more food, drink,...
